'''StaticRangeSumQuery-I

Given an integer sequence A of size N, you are asked to perform Q queries which are of the following type:

L R - Find sum of all the elements from index L to index R of A.
Input Format

First line of input contains N and Q.
Second line contains N space separated integers denoting the sequence A.
Each line in next Q lines will have queries of the given type.
Constraints

1 <= N, Q <= 10^5
0 <= L <= R <= N-1
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9 (0 <= i < N)
Output Format

For each query, output a line with expected answer.

Sample Input 0

6 3
-2 0 3 -5 2 -1
0 2
2 5
0 5
Sample Output 0
