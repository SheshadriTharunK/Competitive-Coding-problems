'''Sum of Left Leaves
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 24
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000'''










if not root:
        return 0

    def is_leaf(node):
        return node and not node.left and not node.right

    left_sum = 0

    if root.left:
        if is_leaf(root.left): 
            left_sum += root.left.val
        else:
            left_sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root.left)  

    left_sum += sumOfLeftLeaves(root.right) 
    return left_sum
