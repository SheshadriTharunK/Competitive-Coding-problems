'''PairSum-II

Given a sorted sequence of N integers and a target X, you are asked to count the number of pairs in the sequence whose sum is X. Assume that the input sequence doesnot contain duplicates.

Input Format

First line consists of N and X.

Second line consists of a sequence of N integers.

Constraints

2 <= N <= 10^6

10^-9 <= X <= 10^9

10^-9 <= numbers of sequence <= 10^9

Output Format

Output a single line with count of pairs whose sum is X.

Sample Input 0

5 6
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 0
