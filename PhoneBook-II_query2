'''PhoneBook-II

Most people must have an experience with maintaining phonebook in your phone. In this problem, you are asked to implement such phonebook that allows three operatons: Adding a contact with name & number, Removing contact details by name and querying number of contact by name.

Assume the following:

Adding a contact with same name replaces the existing value with new value.
Removal operation is performed only on existing contacts.
Querying an existing contact by name should display the corresponding number if exists, "NotFound" otherwise.
Input Format

The first line will have an integer N, representing the total number of operations on phonebook
Next N lines contains an operation per line
Add operation is of the format "A name number"
Remove operation is of the format "R name"
Query operation is of the format "Q name"
Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
A person's name consists of only lower-case english letters and its length will be between 1 and 10.
A phone number has exactly 8 digits without any leading zeros.
Output Format

For each query, print "NotFound" if the person has no entry in the phone book. Otherwise, print the person's phone number.
