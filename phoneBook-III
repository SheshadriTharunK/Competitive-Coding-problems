'''PhoneBook-III

Most people must have an experience with maintaining phonebook in your phone. In this problem, you are asked to implement such phonebook that allows three operatons: Adding a contact with name & number, Removing contact details by name and view the contacts.

Assume the following:

Adding a contact with same name replaces the existing value with new value.
Removal operation is performed only on existing contacts.
View operation displays all contacts sorted by name.
Input Format

The first line will have an integer N, representing the total number of operations on phonebook
Next N lines contains an operation per line
Add operation is of the format "A name number"
Remove operation is of the format "R name"
View operation is of the format "V"
Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
A person's name consists of only lower-case english letters and its length will be between 1 and 10.
A phone number has exactly 8 digits without any leading zeros.
Output Format

For each view, print all the contacts in sorted order within a single line with space separation. The format of each contact is "name=phonenumber". If there are no contacts, display "EMPTY".
